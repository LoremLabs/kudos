# Identity Wallets

## Overview

Identity wallets are non-custodial wallets that allow users to send and receive payments on the XRPL. They also allow users to associate their XRPL account with a DID (Decentralized Identifier) which can be used to send and receive payments.

Identity wallets are part of the Kudos ecosystem which rewards content creators and are the mechanism that users "settle" their kudos for either "fame" or "fortune". "Fame" is a reputation score that is used to rank content creators and "fortune" is a payment that is sent to the content creator.
