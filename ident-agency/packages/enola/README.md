## Enola: Graph Endpoint

Enola is a GraphQL endpoint that provides access to the Kudos data. It is part of the Kudos for Content ecosystem which rewards content creators and is the mechanism that users "settle" their kudos for either "fame" or "fortune". "Fame" is a reputation score that is used to rank content creators and "fortune" is a payment that is sent to the content creator.

## Leaderboards

The leaderboards are a public facing web page that shows the top content creators. The leaderboards are updated every 5 minutes and are based on the reputation score of the content creators calculated via the Quadratic Funding algorithm.
